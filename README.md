The Python Graphics Set is an easy way to create complex games in Python.
![Racing Game sample](https://rollbot.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pgs-sample-image.png)

## Features
The Python Graphics Set includes:
* A fast an easy-to-use 2D renderer, with built in sprite & texture drawing
* A simple UI library
* ~~A fast physics library~~
* ~~Easy 3D~~
* ~~Cross-platform integration~~

Please note that features in strikethrough have not yet been integrated, however are being planned.

## Addons
Designing addons to the PGS is easy. The API is designed to be interfaced with, and you can even directly interact with the backend elements if you so desire.

There are some addons built in already:
* **PGS.UI** - An easy-to-use UI library that's ready for you to use.
* **PGS.Scenes** - An easy way to get scenes working in your game (currently unfinished)
* **PGS.OpenGL** - An OpenGL renderer version of the PGS, currently WIP, will eventually replace the main PGS version once complete.

## FAQ

### Who is the PGS for?
The PGS has been targeted towards any skill level of developer. If you're just starting out, be aware that the PGS is heavily object-oriented, so it may be a good idea to get to grips with object-oriented programming before you decide to give the PGS a go.

The PGS is designed to act somewhere between a rendering framework, and a game engine. You can use it like a basic rendering framework if you choose, dealing with texture drawing & matrix transformations (for camera, etc.) yourself.

But you can also use it more as a game engine, using an ever-growing (and community-creatable!) set of extensions.

For example, while you can draw textures directly to the screen, the PGS includes a sprite system, with built in position, rotation, scale, etc. to make drawing sprites easy! There's also a UI extension, will soon be a physics extension, camera, etc etc.

The PGS is very versatile. Exposing lower-level features for those who want it, and keeping it high level for those who just want to create games.

**If you want to create games in Python, no matter your skill level, the PGS is for you.**

### How do I install?
Please visit our [wiki page on installing the PGS.](https://github.com/ohtrobinson/PGS/wiki/Installing-the-PGS)

### I found a bug! Help!
No problem! The bulk of the PGS was written over the span of two days. There's bound to be plenty of bugs!

If you find a bug, feature, or anything else that doesn't behave how you'd expect, [create a new issue!](https://github.com/ohtrobinson/PGS/issues)

Feel free to submit an issue if you need help about something as well. The documentation is far from finished, so it's okay to ask!

If you need more direct help, [join the discord server!](https://discord.gg/FZt33pNkAp) I'm a lot more active on discord, so it's more like you'll get a response from me there.

### Can I use the PGS in my project?
Sure thing! Just try to remember to credit the PGS, even if it's just a small piece of text in some deep-down about menu somewhere.

Or... You could just leave the "credits" boolean enabled, at which point "Python Graphics Set" will appear in the title of your game window. That's good enough as credit too!

### What about commercially?
Sure thing as well! The same rules as above apply.

I do have one request - Let me know if you do decide to sell your game! I'd love to try it out! :D

### Other questions?
As I said above, feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/ohtrobinson/PGS/issues) or [join the discord server!](https://discord.gg/FZt33pNkAp) As I said above as well, I'm a lot more active on the discord, so any question you ask on there will probably get a lot more of a direct response from me.

Unfortunately, I won't be doing things like pull requests etc. Mostly because I don't know how to use them... Yeah I know...
